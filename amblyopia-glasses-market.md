Increased healthcare expenditure on eye care and the adoption of advanced technologies in eyewear design are further contributing to this trend. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period, reflecting heightened demand among both consumers and healthcare providers. </p><p>Additionally, the growing prevalence of visual disorders among children and a broader emphasis on preventive eye care are driving market expansion. Innovations such as customizable frames and lenses are also becoming increasingly popular, aligning with trends toward personalization and improved patient compliance in the management of amblyopia.</p></p>
