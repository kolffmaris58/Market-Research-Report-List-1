<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Neurovascular Stent Retrievers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expanding Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the Polymer Neurovascular Stent Retrievers market, two primary types are prevalent: balloon expanding stents and self-expanding stents. Balloon expanding stents are deployed by inflation, allowing for precise placement and expansion within the vascular pathway, providing immediate support and stability. In contrast, self-expanding stents are designed to automatically expand upon deployment, adapting to the vessel's contours. Both types aim to enhance neurovascular procedures by improving blood flow and vessel patency while minimizing complications associated with traditional methods.</p></p>
