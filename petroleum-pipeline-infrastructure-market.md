<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Petroleum Pipeline Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission</li><li>Gathering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The petroleum pipeline infrastructure market is primarily divided into two key types: transmission and gathering. Transmission pipelines are designed for long-distance transport of crude oil and refined products, connecting production sites to refineries or storage facilities. These pipelines are often large-diameter and operated at high pressure. In contrast, gathering pipelines are smaller and used to collect oil and gas from multiple production wells and transport it to processing or transmission networks. Both play crucial roles in the energy supply chain.</p></p>
